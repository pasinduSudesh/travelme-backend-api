We did a 4/5-hour hike with a great guide who took the time to point out the various species of flora and fauna (orchids, medicinal plants, lizards, geckos, butterflies, birds, jungle fowl, snakes, spiders, monkeys...). We had a fantastic time and barely crossed any other people along the way. We were also luck because it apparently hadn\u2019t rained for a couple of weeks so we didn\u2019t run into a single leech. Highly recommended for a quick escape into the wilderness!", "Reaching the entrance of the park is an experience of it's own. Had to get there by a 4X4 provided by the owner of Sinharaja Eco lodge. We booked a tour thru him and he provided a very fantastic guide Hemal who speaks good English & had a very observant while walking to show us the many kinds of indigenous Lizards,Spiders and snakes, butterflies, the century old trees etc which can be found only in Sinharaja which is very unique as Sri Lanka being such a small island it cannot be found in the rest of the world. The many waterfalls you come across are wonderful and you can have a dip in it.", "Don't forget to take Leach socks during the rainy season this is a must and having a refreshing bath at the waterfalls.

Need license to get into the park. Must- ask a local guide to help you along the trails. They spot animals and flowers you otherwise miss. The more enthusiastic you get, the more they show you. There are also booklets on trails from their local shop: ok if you want to do the kilomets but the guides see more chamelens, snakes, monitor and stump nose lizards, bush spiders in many varieties, orchids and so on. ", "Went for a walk within the forest together with one of the local guides/ park rangers that are available at the forest entrance. Amazing to walk within the forest and see all the tall trees, butterflies and flowers. You could notice that the guide was very familiar with the forest. He know where to look for specific birds, and took us of the normal big Walking paths to see some small owls sleeping Deep in the forest. Everyone should experience thise once in their Life to get an understanding of why we need to take care of the environment", "So my family and I visited here with our guide. We paid an entrance fee which included the services of a forest guide too. He did not speak English but our guide was luckily able to translate.
