We saw snakecharmers, monitor lizards and, in the evenings, fruit bats.","The best place for people who love to wonder around the small streets with cozy little boutiques and exclusive cafes. Very touristic place yet it did not loose its unique charm. Great architecture and stilish interiors of restaurants. Nice relaxed atmospehere, yet not many street lights after it's getting dark.","We very much enjoyed touring Galle Fort, appreciating the old fortifications, the mix of architectural styles, and opportunities to learn more about the history.","Lots of great shops and restaurants within.","Our driver made the brilliant suggestion of going later in the day to avoid the heat, and take in a stunning sunset. Highly encouraged to do the same."],"analys_state":false}]}
