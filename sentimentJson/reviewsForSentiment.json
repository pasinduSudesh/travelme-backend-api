Of the seven Mahayana statues, three smaller statues each are sculptured on either side of the main Buddha statue.","The centrally sculptured main Buddha image is the tallest in Sri Lanka and is 51feet in height. The Buddha is in the Samabhanga posture and has the right hand gesturing  the Abhaya Mudra. On the right of the Standing Buddha image are the sculptures of Avalokiteshvara Bodhisatva, Goddess Tara,  Prince Sudhana and on the left are the sculptures of Maitree Bodhisatva, Vajrapani Bodhisatva and an unidentifiable deity. These sculptures could be identified as a collection of the Buddha and Bodhisatva figures with Mahayana influence."," ","This site was not particularly busy which was a pleasant change from many Buddhist sites. There are seven rock cut statues of which only the center one is the Buddha. Dating is uncertain but they may have been made in the 10th c AD. Some orange on the Buddha indicate the statues may have been painted. The place name means 'the rock of Buddhist sculptures'. The Buddha statue is 16m/51' high, the tallest Buddha statue in Sri Lanka. You have to remove your shoes to go on the platform.","Our driver didn’t seem to think this was worth the 5km detour but we’re so glad we didn’t listen and requested to view it anyway!

It stands 15mtrs, lonely planet states it being the tallest on the island!","You won’t be sorry for the detour...","We were driving from Udawalawe to Yala and this was en route, so we asked to stop. Its a drive from the main road, but I think that's part of the experience. The area is very quiet, and we saw a massive water monitor crossing the road (the only one in our whole trip).","The statues are interesting, one being the largest in SL, and over 1000 years old (I think) and have similarities to the now lost statues at Bamiyan; excavation work is still going on, so it looks like there's more to be uncovered still from this ancient site","Dropped in on way to Ella out in no mans land very impressive , just the one site to visit , only do it if close by don’t think it would be worth spending hours to drive to nice eating spot just at entrance both together nice ","This site was not particularly busy which was a pleasant change from many Buddhist sites.
