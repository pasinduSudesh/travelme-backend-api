Don't forget to do your yoga on the beach in your teeny tiny bikini in the morning","How exhausting it must be so if you don't have these qualifications dont go to Hiriketiya stick to Dickwella beach.","This beach is known to be a recently developed destination in Sri Lanka. The tourist area is concentrated around lovely beach of a small bay that is surrounded by a green thicket.

We parked our car in the designated car park and walked up about 75 metres to the temple entrance.  Entrance fee for foreigners Rs 250.","The pride of place goes to the 39-metre-tall seated Buddha statue built on a stage shaped as a lotus flower.  This statue, completed in 1976, overlooks a vast courtyard.  The bo-tree at the far-left end of the courtyard looks insignificant in the presence of this colossal statue.  A small chaitya (pagoda) is at the far-right end of the courtyard.  In the middle of the courtyard are two long ponds with large lotus flowers constructed along their central axes.  Since it was a public holiday (24/12), there were many devotees visiting the temple.","At the far end of the courtyard are the steps that lead down to the 600 feet long tunnel complex.  All along the walls of the maze of tunnels are fresco art scenes depicting buddha’s life and those from jathaka stories (related to his previous birth episodes).","The history of the temple is rather short beginning only in the early 20th century.  To me the frescoes and paintings within the tunnel look rather gaudy compared to the serene frescoes seen at other temples!
