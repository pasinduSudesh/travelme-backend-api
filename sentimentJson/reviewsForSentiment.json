Day time its feel like burning but in the evening is the ideal for travel in side the island . The most of the people are very friendly there . there are few guest houses and hotels also ..The beach of island is amazing .. there are so many ruins of dutch colonial .","It took us an hour to get to the harbor. We were told a boat would go at 8 - which it didn’t. We had to wait until 9:30. The boat was packed full. The sea was terrible and the water came into the boat and it was rocking a lot. I bet everyone on the boat thew up. Thank god the boat ride was free. The ride took nearly 1,5 hours.","There are tuktuks to take you around the island and see the sights. We felt so terribly ill from the boat ride that we took only a short tour. ","Boats back leave 14:30 and 16:30. Thankfully the way back was smooth sailing. We suggest sitting in the back of the boat - then and water shouldn’t come into the boat. ","We really suggest looking at the wind and weather situation before heading there. If the hotel staff says it’s too windy, then it definitely is. ","Was an average tour i guess as its a 1.15min ride on boat to Island. Mostly isolated and empty houses we went on a tour of the island in a hired van which cost us around 6k. Nothing much to see other than a load of abandoned houses and a few attractions.. Good for a first time traveller to experience it","A great link with the past. Access is easy and free. We enjoyed our leisurely walk on the ramparts and  grounds. As with other historical locations this would benefit with more info on the history to the present time. What is the link with other Dutch forts? Neglect of this historical perspective is sad. Grounds are unkempt and toilets terrible. ","Preservation can be funded if foreigners were charged a small fee.","This Island is the biggest island of Sri Lanka . If you are wishing to go there , you should be take more stuffs that you need essentially because  it's expensive the things in the island , The time table of the cruse also the important , There are few free of charge cruses also operate by Sri lankan Navy . most of the cruses are very hot inside cabin and feel suffocation also , but while the traveling it would be fine and it's allow to go outside the cabin during the traveling .

The boat ride took about an hour carrying about 100 people.  The trip one-way cost Rs 80. The boat trip was not uncomfortable, sitting on fiberglass seats.  No life vests were required as it was a large boat. ","Delft island is small - only about 50 sq. Km., oval shaped, and based on limestone and corals.  The population is about 2500.  Worship facilities are available for Hindus and Christians.  There are seven schools in this little island.  The land is flat, dry and arid with brackish water.  People are poor, fishing being their livelihood.  Most houses as well as the surrounding boundary walls are built with coral stones.  Palmyra trees provide some shade from the hot sun. ","We toured in the only minibus available on the island.  We had lunch at a hotel named \"Delft Samudra\".  I was surprised to learn that they have sixteen airconditioned, well maintained rooms.  Good for a one-night stay allowing you to explore the island as well as watch both sunrise and sunset. ","Wild horses roaming around is a sight unique to Delft.  We spent quite a bit of time watching them frolic and play.  Watering tanks had been built for them.  Portuguese had introduced them and they now number about 2000.   In addition to seeing the ponies we could only visit the huge Baobab tree, the little Dutch Fort and the pigeon post as we had only limited time at Delft since we had to return in time for the last boat leaving for the mainland at 4.30p.m. ","I shall certainly return here to spend a day at the island.","A great link with the past.
