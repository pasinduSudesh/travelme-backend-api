{"reviews":[{"place":"Galle International Stadium, Galle Galle District Southern Province","reviews":["The stadium looks really nice from the fort. It was a great feeling to observe cricket being played at the stadium. The setting is just marvelous.","With the Indian Ocean the proverbial stone's throw away, the location of the pitch is surely one of the most compelling. It was started as a race track in 1876, only permanently becoming a cricket pitch in 1927. It was extensively damaged in the 2004 tsunami, acting as a point of refuge due to its size. International matches are played here. The view of the stadium from Galle Fort is beautiful.","The cricket stadium is much bigger than I thought and well kept. You can get good views from the walls of the fort. My only sadness is that there was no match on. Definitely worth a look. Ask the locals like we did as you may be lucky to see a cricket match. ","I didn't enter the stadium but watched the scenic view from the galle fort. Wow simply awesome stadium touching distance from the sea. It should be one of the scenic stadiums in the world where there is a high possibility that the ball one day will be hit into the sea.","Located in front of the Galle Fort and surrounded by the Indian ocean on two sides, this stadium has had a recent introduction to international cricket with the first match played in 1998. It was devastated by the 2004 tsunami and was not again used until December 2007. Shane Warne and Ian Botham are revered here for their major contributions towards the cost of renovations.

I am not sure if or how much you pay but assume some fee is involved as there is a gentleman there that assists you. You can swing for a few minutes. The beach and setting are nice. It was relatively quiet. We stopped for about fifteen minutes in the afternoon.","The swing on Dallawella Beach is a MUST!

The owner charges a fee to use the swing and he told us the reason he charges is because people use the swing and don’t get off of it.  So, now he charges Rs 500 per person but you get 3 rides on the swing for that.  In US dollars that is just under $3, so I was perfectly fine with paying.  This is an example of social media blowing up a little tree swing and making a local guy a lot of extra money, good for him, I support it.  My teenage kids had a great time for few bucks.","The other way to get access to the swing is purchase some drinks and they will let you ride the swing. ","Note - we visited in June so the sea was very rough.  It’s ok because you get off the swing on the beach.
