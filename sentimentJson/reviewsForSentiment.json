Through a dust road of roughly 3km you will climb a hill and Terrassos winery will be at the top with a splendid view of The Valley. There is a deck with seating where you may sit, orders glass of wine and just watch the scenery, relaxing. They offer a wine tasting (5 types of wines produced inside the property); there is a tour showing the process of wine production. If you go for lunch (book in advance or you may go and try to find a table or take advantage of someone that didn't show up) there is a restaurant that serves pasta (on Saturdays served as \"rodízio\" (5 types of pasta served on the \"rodízio\" style). ","Nice view and great food. Definitely should be in your to do list for lunch :) the wine is also very good.","The place is beautiful, the service is impeccable and the food is delicious! I was there with my family and no one was disappointed. The homemade pastas were so good that it is hard to chose the best one. The view is breathtaking and there is even a wine tour.","I recommend it!!!!!","Been there today and tasted syrah 2014 - best wine!!!","Thanks to the nascimento family for great hospitality and great wine.","We were very well received by the owners, the view from 870 m is amazing. A tour in the \"factory\". Then wine tasting and some cheese. You can also buy all the different wines at a good price.
