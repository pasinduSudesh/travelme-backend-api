{"result": ["This is one of the impressive site not to be missed when visiting g Polonnaruwa Ancient Site that is inclusive in the entrance fee of USD25. It is the rock temple with 4 massive sculptures of Buddha figure at the granite rock - 2 Buddha statues with seated position; 1 standing Buddha statue; and 1 Reclining Buddha statue. Appropriate attire is expected and no shoes are allowed at this site. Impressive work and heritage since 12th century. ", "Place looks nice and they take good care of it. Here you can see three statues carved out of the rocks", "We spent most of one day visiting, self driving through the area with our rented tuktuk. The tickets are a little pricey and the area is not well explained with the documentation you are given. Basically the ticket is for three areas, and they tear off a stub for each one as you enter that particular part. I was under the impression that this particular area wasn\u2019t sacred and forgot to bring a sarong to tie around my waist, which limited me from a few things. Frustrating, as there are no signs anywhere and nothing on their brochure about this.  I also wasn\u2019t alerted while shelling out the $25 US for my ticket. I usually come prepared and in this case, it was my own fault. That said, the sites are interesting, but you really need to come prepared with a guide or hire someone to take you around. The Lonely Planet section on this will suffice for a self guided tour. Many people were riding bikes, which is cheap and seemed like a good way to get around. Take socks with you if you want to go into the sacred places with no shoes. The ground is blisteringly hot!", "I'm ashamed to admit I only wanted to go here because I love the Save A Prayer video (Duran Duran fans will be with me here)!  However, forget the 80s nostalgia element, this is an awesome temple complex.  The statues are massive but beautifully done, and one of the few temples I've visited on travels recently that doesn't have a zillion steps to it so that was a bonus for the old legs.  It looks pretty much the same as the 1982 video save for a roof to protect the rock.  Go for the amazing sight and the history though, not for following your teenage pop dream :-)", "some what ruined by the ugly structure, put up to protect them. That said the 3 statues in sitting, standing and reclining meditation are the best on the island and should be a place for quite contemplation.
